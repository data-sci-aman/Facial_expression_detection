The source code to create an application that detects facial expression.

Description - The applications access images through webcam and detects the facial expression in real-time and labels it.

Software and tools requirement

Github.com

VS CODE IDE

[HerokuAcoount]

[GIT CLI]

Programming language used - Python, HTML

Libraries - Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, Flask, Tensorflow, Keras

Solution -

1- Trained a ML model using CNN architecture on various images containing different facial expressions.

2- Performed hyperparameter tuning to experiment with different CNN architectures to find optimal model performance

3- Developed an opencv application to use webcam to capture image and detect face and then run predictions on it

4- Develop an flask application to host the entire apllication as web API
